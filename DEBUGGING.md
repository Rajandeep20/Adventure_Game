# Debugging the Minecraft Adventure Game  

## Key Debugging Spots  

### Breakpoint 1: After User Input  
- *Where*: In addAnswerButton function.  
- *Code*: currentState = newState;  
- *Why*: This is when the player's choice is taken into account but hasn’t yet affected the game.  

### Breakpoint 2: After Decision Making  
- *Where*: At the end of the renderQuestion function.  
- *Code*: if (answerSelected) { nextButton.style.display = 'block'; }  
- *Why*: This determines if the right question shows up next based on the player’s choice.  

### Breakpoint 3: Restarting the Game  
- *Where*: In the restartGame function.  
- *Code*: renderQuestion();  
- *Why*: This ensures the game resets and displays the first question correctly.  

## Debugging Overview  

### Breakpoint 1 State  
- *Variables*:   
  - currentState: (e.g., 'enchantedForest')  
  - answerSelected: false  

### Breakpoint 2 State  
- *Variables*:   
  - currentState: (e.g., 'enchantedForest')  
  - answerSelected: true  

### Breakpoint 3 State  
- *Variables*:   
  - currentState: 'start'  
  - answerSelected: false  

## Transition Insights  

### From Breakpoint 1 to 2  
- *What Changed*: The state updates to show the user’s choice, setting answerSelected to true.  
- *Expectation*: This confirms the program correctly processes inputs.  

### From Breakpoint 2 to 3  
- *What Changed*: The game resets to the initial state, ready for a new round.  
- *Expectation*: The program behaves as expected, preparing for a fresh start.  

## Critical State Analysis  

### Reviewing Breakpoint 2  
- *Insight*: This is a crucial moment; the game is ready to present the next question.  
- *Behavior Check*: Yes, it is working as intended since the transition reflects the player’s choice. This keeps the game engaging and on track for the next steps.
